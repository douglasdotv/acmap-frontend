# Acmap Frontend

This is the frontend of the Acmap project, created using Angular. It presents an interactive web application for visualizing and analyzing air crash incidents globally. The frontend retrieves data from the [backend](https://github.com/douglasdotv/acmap-backend), displaying it on an interactive Leaflet map and providing an intuitive and responsive user experience.
